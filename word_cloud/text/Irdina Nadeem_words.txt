Then go to the Indiana dunes whereâs thereâs a beach for a day. And then go to Chicago and stay in a hotel for a day or 2 where we can go to museums and walk around the city. Go to a fancy restaurant or have a photo shoot. This total cost would be under $200 per person and would be like 4-5 daysSmoky mountains would be like a camping trip for a few nights and we could stop in a hotel on the drive there and do something fun depending on where we stop. The drive is 9-10 hours and the total cost would be $285/person for 6 days total but like 3-4 actually campingSo the cruise Iâm guessing will be 400-600 per person depending on what we do there and where we go. Itâll be harder to convince parents thoughSo Iâve got 3 options 
1) cruise
2) smoky mountains
