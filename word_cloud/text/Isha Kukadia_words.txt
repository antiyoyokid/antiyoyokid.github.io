scratch might be betterBecause he's reviewingThen you should go to 233So we can peep itBut they could just pick up last week's quizWhich they don't actually have to stay inBut aishik and irdina have labI dont really care either wayafter what @Elaine Wangso I'm guessing no 225 todaymy bdid it help@Elaine Wang can you send me the picture you took of those cache equations from discussionIf you don't start at block offset 0, the horseshoe might be in one block and the size in the next onebut it might be fakeand that would technically be afterI think it's because it only asks until the jr is completedor if it's already in the cacheif you divide it into tag, index, offset, you can see if you're overwriting the old valuethere's a pl for this?Wade a secondgets an 80"kinda bad"I believe in you guysI forgot you had statsomg these poor kidsezpass out pt 2maybe we can pass out during the exam and get an exemptionwhy does herman actually hate usfrom the 2015 examalso does anybody know why this is 2ohhh gotchawouldn't that be flush not stall?what was itcan't you just resubmit?ez moneyhow was your examhe forces himself to slow downfor future instructionsbut only one counts as a writeso when you have a lw or sw (or any base plus offset) do both registers (rs and rt) count as reads as far as dependences are concerned?hello it's me againI'm not touching that until tom nightImaginewe got thisalright guysseems a little fakeisn't s0 itself the addressnot the valueyou just care about the addresswhy?or is that fakeso there's no dependence again?so you're going write to writewait but back to this one isn't the sw t0 the source?other way right?guess we'll never find outwowbc I already clicked next questionoh wait I sent the wrong picif there's no dependenceso then why are they stalling the sw?hi there's no dependence here rightWe can look at aishik and irdina's quizonly 233imagine having to go to oh for the first time all semester 2 weeks before finalsI haven't looked at the practice ones but I wouldn't be surprised if they were fake lolSwaren't you writing to t3 in the lw and reading from it in Sq?Even though technically when you do base plus offset you're looking for the address not the value at that addressI think it's any write to any readI thought he did it correctly?ð°do you need me to rub a peanut on my forehead and feed it to youand elaine diedI leave
