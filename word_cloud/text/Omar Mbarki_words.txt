than 433, and then my last sem I take stuff and let things spill over to mcs if I get in. if I don't get in, I take 6 classes insteadmy cs mentor teaches 433!didn't hear back but im just gonna assume that everything went ok bc they sent an email saying they received the applicationlike summer I thinkif I don't get into mcs it's the schedule I have to go withidt i can do 483 next sem bc that's the class I wanna take the most so I wanna spend the majority of my time on it+ 1 means I would take the 4 ch versionno if I get into mcs ill end up taking the ones I wanna takeim so sad I don't have room

of us guys this is going to be toughimagine finishing today lolwe don't actually have correct code though so don't get excitedpassing test 1 & 137.4 seconds for 4 bytes new world recordit should work as long as the structs are in free memoryinstead of allocating 2^32 at the start and splitting downwards, I think we can start from the bottom and grow up as neededI think we can make an implementation where the initial allocation is empty, but we already have the logic for where the initial allocation is 2^32 so I think we should try to get it working firstperfectincluding

kill cont and stop commands but those are easyguys part 2 is really not bad im at 7/14 and that's with failing all the ps testsyou guys look cute thoughI look like a serial killer in all these picturesin my realloc I was only allocating request_size instead of request_size + sizeof(meta_data)6/6 nowyeah just took a look at my lab and fixed a dumb mistakei need to do 210idk we'll figure it out thomemorythen @Hungsomeone make a piazza post that links to this threadwhich one of you guys posted thisððððwhat if they can't fix it bc they don't know how towhat are the chances they make it so that not implementing background doesn't give you the hundo85% isn't the worst and if we don't figure it out then we can just not implement backgroundwell we gave it our best shotð¨if this doesn't work then we have 4 more autograder runs for tonight to try out different thingsand the piazza says to close the file descriptors before calling execI think that's worse bc we would have to do that for every time we call fopen() and maybe there are other file descriptors we need to closethis is a good stack overflow I foundhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5713242/linux-fork-prevent-file-descriptors-inheritanceyou live and you learnshouldn't have wasted my run last nightI fixed it and still have a 0 for backgroundidt they test for thatyeahlike you only setpgid for background processesyou implemented background processes rightmake sure it works first?but the first 3 are stdin stdout stderr I thinkthere are 256 file descriptors and they're just intsI meant like now but saving it for tonight is fine toocan one of you guys add that for loop before exec and run the autograderi closed stdin before calling exec before running the autograderyeah idk which file descriptors to close and the only way to know if it works is to run the autograderno just like runningI guess we just gotta close our file descriptorsit's ok I can just uncomment my code and get a 34nothe bet was that you will get a 34 it has nothing to do with menothing just put it in another methodive never been happier in my entire lifetechnically we can get all the points by not doing background at alltests are def fake bc they said so themselveseyahctrl c is non-zerobackground points should come when they fix their testsI just use the status codes for cds and externalsmaybe it's something else that's wrong33/34it's overdoes the order look rightbut it still prints out the same output as my other codethis is my new and improved file readerno rush bc I already used my autograder for tonightno it's okim desperatethat's the same order I have it in time to use fgetsit's over im getting max 33/34bc I thought they wanted getline() -> check if -1 -> print command -> process inputim giving up on clean code and am gonna copy paste my while loop into another method but I wanna know the order of operations that they expectyeahthe file code you sent was the history file code but I need the regular file codeloloh you call your variable wait_statdo you setpgid for every processctrl c doesn't kill the foreground process for you after you added the macros?bc currently my order is: getline() -> check if -1 -> print_command -> handle inputok guys I need one of you to hmu with a pic of your file while loopquit() is my method for cleaning up then calling exitchange quit(WEXITSTATUS(status)) to quit(1)this is how I used the macrosif you just press enterdoes it go into external?^so we have different output for file 1 command?noâ100%and run itcan one of you guys make a file that just says "echo what the"everyone and their mom is passing the file tests I have 0 clue why I still failbc we fixed wiatyeah it's not supposed to quit the shellyou guys are at 29no I got 28 bc of the -fnopebut guys i'm still failing the -f test for 1 command for some reasonI think the if (status == 0) messed up everythingbut my background is perfect so i think it's just their tests need to be updatedwe're only failing backgroundprediction: 24didnt' run it yetwhat if we need to print_usage)(ok ill run it nowishyeah I kill the sleepso that's not even possiblealso they didn't even change the background process tests rightim getting 20you're so funny I don't even have 2/5 for historywhat are the chancesshould I run it guysive been trying so hard to kill my shell with ctrlcwhy are we failing ctrl + conly thing that should cause the shell to exit at this point is something that makes fork() exec() or wait() fialif I mash my enter key should my history file just be a bunch of newlinesshould we store all input to historyanother huge questionso good stuffso then now something like fadlsjf || echo hi would print hi and we still exit when wait failswe were saying exit when the program doesn't return 0you definitely use the macros bc then we actually exit when the wait failsso I gotta fix that oneI did and I failed a bunch bc my invalid_addresses number is always wrongit's confirmedyeah it's def the movethe wait status changes?should the history file have a newline at the endwhat are the chanceswhat if I run the autograderyupso I think u print it regardlessyou def have to print if before waitingcd isn't external that's whyquick question do you guys think we need to Command executed by pid=<pid> if we pass in an incorrect commandchange your if (status != 0) to if (!WIFEXITED(status))yeah that should fix everythingWIFEXITEDthe safe bet is to use the macrosyeah I think our if statement is wrong because a wait failing is different than the status being nonzeroshould be if (status == -1)I think we just need to change our if statement after wait and it'l work outas long as we exit after a fork, exec, or wait fails we can't print hi if we do fdjkasjda || echo hiexternal commands don't always return 0they're saying if you have a command that executes, but returns with a non-zero valuebc it doesn't get executedno like a command that doesn't exist cant even have an exit statusyeah but they said to exit if you fail to fork, exec, or waitpretty sure echo hi can't executelike if you say fdjkafjdsak || echo hiI think if a command fails u can't recover and u just exitI thought ; means u just do two commands regardlesslike I have to fundamentally change my shellI really don't wanna do this && history thingyeah I saw that post yesterday but the comments on the bottom didn't exist yettime to pass a Boolean flag to my methodlol good stuffcan you link the piazzaoh I feel youwe get full points on && but not || and ;what are the chances they test for htatjust makes senseseparatelyand idek if it'll pass their testright0 orphans no mem leaksseems to workI just added a background processes vector and kill them in my quit methodmaybe when they change the background tests we start passing themthanks! | 1dontmy guyyashaI made a quit() method where I clean up everything and exit with a status codeyeah or you can pass the vector in as a parameternoor you can just use a string vector for nowyou have to make your own copy constructor, default constructor, and destructor then pass them into vector_create()there are so many videosjust in casei just did a process vector but idk if that's necessarynot sure if string vector is enough but there's a chance it could bethat's crazy didn't know

itGl guysThat's hotDiligentI m not surviving todayGuys I'm so sad I'm gonna do so bad on this test and stats tmrwI didn't look at that problem but if I do I'll let u know for sureNot sure about that thoSo I think 32 and 64 can workThe idea with prefetching is u wanna grab a row below you while grabbing ur current rowProbably bc the cache is 64 bytes widewhen u can't even do those probelmsand there's no time for 233 i'm looking at these cache problems and lowkey faintingim gonna take the 0 on stats I've been to 0 lectures and don't even know the topicsdude you've been studying since the dawn of timeme  a fthere's not enough timeboys it's overRight imagineIf ur code compiles u get 5%If u do only insert and remove u get an 80%For the second one the grading was broken down for you and super lenientFor the second one you have to implement insert, remove, and resizetable for double hashingFor the first one u have to implement heapifyUp and heapifyDown, and then use your heap for a problemFor me the programming exam was lab_heap and lab_hashTha doesn't change anythingSo if a register holds the number 4 and u use it in the context of a sw(4) it interprets that 4 as an addressAll registers hold values and u can use those values as addressesIf u change the 3 to a 2 with a load u need to stallUr storing at address 3If s0 has a 3 in it and u do sw($s0) ur doing sw (3)Yeah but s0 holds the value of the addressIt's a dependency bc sw needs the updated s0 valueLike moveYeah everything else is destination, sourceYeahNo it's vice versaLw is writing to s0It's a destination for lw and a source for sw so there's a deplet's bake a cakecuteLet's all study 233 tmrwI'm scaredIdt there's enough time for me to study 233 tmrw and learn statsyeah i'm looking over 357 before going to

3rd one it should be 4 squares on a diagonalyeahpotdidk I feel like asking about it isn't a movei've transcended the colorsthe data science people were gray or somethingI interviewed for swe though i'm so confused, they gave everyone a badge with a certain color and my color was red which meant sweis it really better than web dev thoughit took them 3 weeks bc they tried to find the thing I liked the leastguys i'm going to at&tLol tell them to send me an offerI'll give you insider infowe're timing out in part 2 so we have to not make Point() copies all the timesWoohoo!instead of &= think of it like board[I][k] = board[I][k] & ~valueso I said "not dest, src" but idk if that's right1) calculate ~value
2) calculate board[I][k] (gonna be multiple lines)
3) calculate board[I][k] & ~value
4) sw into board[I][k]if that if statement is true you should jump to the l loopMoons apartmentyou have to load tree[I] into a variable right, bc u don't store anythingyeah but u do lwRu enjoying ur time with Joseph SiegerYeah{somewire, {2'b0}}Implying ik how to do it4pmAlso we got the 7 extra credit for the mp even tho dfs is wrongAlvina my code is exactly like the solutionSo we put the value 31 on one side of the mux, and the old write register on the other sideWe were supposed to write to register 31It had a third one where write register isWe were really close we actually needed 1 more mux bc of R[31]I did it last nightjust did it bc it was simpleryeah but it doesn't make a diffit's that really tiny black dotupdate we found the differencealso here's our new pop() for dfsspot the difference tell me why i'm still failing this testThat's the moveor maybe change the saturation by like 0.05 so there's only a subtle differencelol for elaine's next piazza post she should use the exact same picture as before but fill the image with illini orange so it looks like a still imageso in conclusion our hacky fix for part might not be goodfalse alarm for the dfs it's because I didn't have if statementsit misses the bottom right corner for some reasonmight just be me because I don't have if statements in my dfs pop, peek, etc.for part 2 in the mp bfs works but dfs segfaults right at the endwe just added this if statement at the end of ++part 1mp is donerohan :heart_eyes:just so you guys know there's 233 prairielearn due tonightI didn't store symbolist in the s registers I just load it each time in the loop with laYeahBc they were full before sending me an offerI just had a dream where I didn't get MicrosoftSame way u do the offset for the other arrayFirst u have to load symbolistYeah I did num as the offsetâ¤I didn't start the lab yet which is scary liti'm doing stat rn still haven't started 233yeah come overIt's so sad at the apartmentim trying not to fail this 357 test but I also have so much work to dotoday is such a bad dayworld recordI think the move for me is to study in my dorm, take the test in a few hours, and then go to the apartmentwhat a geniuswhen are you taking ithmmmmmI need  to studysnaggednahtime slots usually open up so I gotta keep refreshing this cbtf pagethat's excitingouchlolbousfieldand I didn't study yetI have to register for my cbtf 357 test and today is the last day but the only one available is 3pmanyway I have a Big IssueI slept like a good studentcutewhat did u guys do last nightWhat Ru guys up togood morningI love those questionslol first we have to rotate an image 90 degrees, now u have to rotate a binary tree 90 degreesit's good that you're younger than themwhich companies did u interview for todayaishik how were ur interviewsI think they're doing team placement but i'm not sureor did it really happenwas the phone call I had with the recruiter a dreamalso my ms offer still didn't get sentso I won't be surprised if for mine or isha's tree question they had a wrong answerhonestly it's so fakebc I was crushed after hitting grade instead of (d)lmk why it's c when line 3 existsbtw this was the constructor question from exam 1im gonna have to start going to lectureyeah follow the vidlike +10% to my grade is no jokei'm not upset anymore bc we have so much extra creditbut I got confused so I was like im gonna list out all the numbers and make a bst out of itmakes sense, I should've probably tried every one with the order they gave instead of changing my stratI forgot reallythere were a bunch like thatbc if u don't follow it in the order they give there are multiple ways of drawing it, but I tried it in the order they gave and it was wrong so I was like lol im just gonna guess from now on bc it's not worth itit's not I was just confusedstill wrongI also tried that with a question I think it was the letter oneand that cycle kept repeatingthen I drew it a different way for a different question bc my tree for the other one was wrongI drew it so that the inorder traversal would be sorted least to greatestBut then I was like maybe they don't want me to do thayI definitely was for at least one of themThe questions are easyI was jjuet super confusedUll do fineI got a 76%I made a legit bst multiple times and still got it wrong so I have upDrawing a bit isn't hard but it was confusing because they said In This Specific orderNot bc I didn't know how to do the problem but because I drew a bst, did the problem and got it wrongI got every single question like that wrongI'm scaredI just did thatso we probably need to do the bound checks not in isvalidbut the makefile doesn't let u say if (x < 0) bc it treats that as an errorthe problem with the mp is that x and y are unsigned, so when u do 0 - 1 it overflows into intmaxI'm busting out the fleece lined pantsU just sent a bunch of picturesWhat messagesdelete calls the destructor but free doesn't and same thing with malloc and newNow ppl use new and deleteBack when people used malloc()free is old practice I thinkOkWhy do we need to know vimWho asked him a technical questionYeah but the second interview was with another guyBc Joseph is good friends with the recruiterSnapchat rejected him but then they gave him another interviewIdk he's waiting on snapchatYeah he's Joseph Sieger 2.0I have to buy aishik signature grill unfortunatelyYeah that's ur ticket inAlso aishik is gonna destroy his interviewI never agreed to thatIt's good bc suhi is also gonna be in that areaThat way I can't get disappointedThanks guys I rlly convinced myself I got rejected yesterdayAdd that to the listCo grays!Phone call happened and it was good news so I'm going to class todayJk I'm doing labProbably gonna start the mp soonI'm eating food rnElaine Alvina shallom irdina meYeah!Everyone should come overAnd they said addm isn't right but it def isLike they said all the original instructions like add, or, and are wrongI got like a 50something out of 80Can't be a genius if I can't get into msftDw I still got rejectedOh lolI'm super scaredBut there's a seatAlways 4thi'm gonna be the only person who doesn't get itriya probably got inno bc i'm def getting rejectedMatrix what's the move for cbtfHuge step in the right directionThe good news is that they don't check for memory leaks so you can just set firstFreeNode->next = nullptr and that'll workSo inUse -> free -> free should be inUse -> freeIf there are consecutive free nodes just delete everything after the first free nodeOr instead of calling std::sort u can do that urselfYeah makes me feel productiveAlso when you sort your vector you want to compare your elements like: return a->inUse > b->inUse;Didn't start currently doing laundryHundo pWhat rowIs there a seatLolDid you guys say that all tests passed and your pictures were identical to the expected ones?They're saying that sort fails but it's given to us so that means mergesort is wrong are more expensivewe are bankrupting Microsoft guys watch the stock go down as I drain their moneythe 15 minute ride was 50 dollarsevery 5 seconds the price went up 30 centslol on the taxi ride there was a machine that said the amount you had to payYeah but I don't wanna go down there and be like where's the toothpaste and they're lol idiot did u check the bathroomThey have a king sized bed but no toothpasteI thought that a hotel would provide toothpaste is that too much to askThe Snagguess I gotta ask the front desk for toothpasteguys idt there's toothpaste what do I doDo u think they have toothpaste bc I can't find anyGuys where do u think the toothpaste is in my hotel roomI agreeYeah i filled up a set with values and then when I iterate through it I make new nodesYou don't deallocate anything just return the new listU make a new Node() every time you wanna add an elementWe r grilling Herbert for giving an unfair problem last testWe miss you irdina stop coughingI got the same questions too can I also be an aliasIt doesn't matterWhen are we popping outGonna be lateWe can do it in like 2 hours probablyI just read the stuff for part 1 mp3 and it's mashed bananasAlso can't wait to go back to attCan't wait until you get a FB jobYeah trueThey sometimes ask only oneYou have to be more into itU didn't do it properlyListen to win by tee grizzley and ull be fineJust woke up it's so lateWhat rowOkIs there a seat for meI'm gonna be lateDoubt itYeah we do@Isha Kukadia where have you been all dayLol I can't bc I have workNothingCome here ill make u a grilled cheeseWhere is everyoneNot gonna finishRelatable I have to write basically a thesis paper by tonightYeah spread the wordEveryone who's not at the apartment come to the apartmentLet's learn todayYeah@Isha Kukadia come to the apartment@Isha Kukadia ur playing this timeI'll take a couple of boxes off your handsWowLol where r u guys @Elaine WangOkey dokesOkMe aishik ishaWish me lucjI'm coming from rightRight*Should I come from left or right afterWhat row Ru inYeah@Suhirtha RajThe stickers and image only get drawn when the render() method is calledOkRigytOmar has 2 balls left.

a hard oneI did assignI got an 82%And the other one was literally just unsigned binary addition but I thought that 1 + 1 = 3Yeah so I actually did it by hand and got the same thing and i was like wow I'm the worstI then mistype the answer and get -10 pointsOne of them was worth 20 points and it was the shifting one so I put it in pythonI rlly do think I have a concussionLol I'm the stupidest

we travelled 12 milesTrueIn this case you can do both but if you don't need a pointer don't use a pointerYeah it would be pointing to a stack variable if u don't use newReferences are aliasesWith pointers u have to deal with heap memory by either making new memory on the heap or pointing to existing memory on the heapYeah also it's an a l i a s and ur not dealing with heap memory0 memory leaks possibleCant segfaultBc references are safer and do the same thing in that scenarioSpirit is gonna arrest meOk I'll buy a different plane ticketNot worth itBc we went to sleep after u  video chattedWe

siebelRu guys still at siebelComing to the apartmentAight boys did the labI'm using vimIdk if u can use atom thoI used python in the terminal during 357Maybe I read the code wrong but I looked at it for a whileIt was a which of the following is trueThe one where the choices r wrong I think was a class with a constrctorI'm all about academic integrityOne where I'm sure all the choices r wrong, the one where I didn't select an answer, and one of the questions after that bc I was sad and wanted the Pain to endI'm a victim of ruthless bullyingDo u not know what that meansImagine if I didn't get 3 wrong on the easiest 225 testYeah so it stores the memory address of a pointerThere was 1 question with double pointers225 didn't have any hard pointer questions357 was pancakesThere were questions like "how many constructors does this class have"There were a few questions on how many stack and heap variables are declared which were super easy bc u just count the number of times u say newThere are 17 questionsI'm sorry tooAt the end I got 3 wrong bc of the TiltThe questions are pretty easy though I'm just p upsetClicked grade instead of the right answer got a 0% got tilted and spent 2 seconds on every question after thatSoonA crackheadSo they just replied to 1 starYeah but the text didn't go thruTHEY REPLIED@Elaine Wang can u get the frisbeeOkCute@Isha Kukadia @Elaine Wang  wyaI'm

done with classes at 4So no &Make sure the temp variable isn't a referenceSo temp = first; first = second; second = tempJust get a reference to two pixels and have a temp variable to switch themExcept 125 was harder bc u had to rotate 90 degrees instead of 180LolEz moneyOh shootLittyI'm near the acmI thought I had 2Ru guys still at the labIdk if it works tho I just wrote itWhere u guys atDidn't
